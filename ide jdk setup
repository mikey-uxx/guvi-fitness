JDK, IDE  SETUP
 
Following is the set up of our JDK (Java Development Kit) and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
for our fitness and nutrition web application:
 
 
The JDK is required to compile and run Java programs.
 
1. Download JDK
 
Visit the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK website.
 
Download the latest version (e.g., JDK 17 or 21) compatible with your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).
 
 
2. Install JDK
 
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
 
During installation, note the installation path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).
 
 
3. Set Environment Variables
 
Open System Properties:
 
On Windows: Press Win + S and search for "Environment Variables".
 
 
Add a new System Variable:
 
Name: JAVA_HOME
 
Value: JDK installation path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).
 
 
Update the Path variable:
 
Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to the Path.
 
 
 
4. Verify Installation
 
Open a terminal or command prompt.
 
Run:
 
java -version
 
It should display the installed JDK version.

Step 2: Install an IDE
 
We had two options for this , they are the following:
 
 
 
1. IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended for Spring Boot)
 
Download: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
 
Features:
 
Built-in support for Spring Boot.
 
Excellent debugging and auto-completion.
 
 
 
 
2. Eclipse IDE
 
Download: Eclipse IDE.
 
Features:
 
Good for general Java development.
 
Lightweight compared to IntelliJ.

Step 3: Configure IDE for Spring Boot
 
If using IntelliJ IDEA:
 
1. Install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
 
 
2. Install the Spring Boot Plugin (if not pre-installed):
 
Go to File > Settings > Plugins.
 
Search for "Spring Boot" and install it.
 
 
 
3. Create a Spring Boot Project:
 
Open IntelliJ and select New Project > Spring Initializr.
 
Choose dependencies:
 
Spring Web
 
Spring Data JPA
 
MySQL Driver
 
Spring Security (if needed)
 
 
Set the project SDK to the installed JDK version.
 
Click Finish to generate the project structure.
 
 

 
If using Eclipse:
 
1. Install the Spring Tool Suite (STS) plugin:
 
Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
 
Search for "Spring Tool Suite" and install.
 
 
 
2. Create a new Spring Boot project:
 
Go to File > New > Spring Starter Project.
 
Configure dependencies and project structure.

Step 4: Install MySQL
 
1. Download and Install MySQL:
 
Visit MySQL Downloads.
 
Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
 
 
2. Configure Database:
 
Set up a root password during installation.
 
Create a database for your application:
 
CREATE DATABASE fitness_app;
 
 
3. Test Connection:
 
Use MySQL Workbench to connect to the database.
 
Verify the connection using the root user and the password you set.
